# Snake-Game-Console-Based
This Snake Game project, developed by Muhammad Zohaib Warraich, is a classic implementation of the Snake game using C++. The game features a dynamic and interactive environment where the player controls a snake to consume fruits, with each consumption increasing the snake's length and the player's score.

## Features:
-> User Input Handling: 
                      The game utilizes the <iostream> library for input and output operations and <unistd.h> for controlling the speed of the snake.
                      
-> Randomized Fruit Placement: 
                            Fruits are placed at random positions on the grid using the rand() function.

-> Dynamic Tail Growth: 
                      The snake's tail grows dynamically as it consumes fruits, with positions stored in dynamically allocated arrays to ensure efficient memory management.

-> Game Setup and Control: 
                        The game initializes with a fixed grid size and starting positions for the snake and fruit. Players can start the game, control the snake's direction, and quit at any time.

-> Collision Detection: 
                      The game checks for collisions with the grid boundaries to determine when the game is over.

-> Score Management: 
                  Player scores are updated in real-time and stored in a file for later review.

With clear instructions for gameplay, the project showcases fundamental programming skills and dynamic memory management in C++.

# Snake-Game-Console-Based
This Snake Game project, developed by Muhammad Zohaib Warraich, is a classic implementation of the Snake game using C++. The game features a dynamic and interactive environment where the player controls a snake to consume fruits, with each consumption increasing the snake's length and the player's score.
